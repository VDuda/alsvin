## Inspiration
Both of us come from the eCommerce space as well as the retail space - we see the disconnection between offline and online experiences. We're heavily involved with retail experiences. Vlad recently traveled to Germany where there was a significant emphasis on "experiences" - visiting the JBL (Harman audio) flagship store. The products themselves weren't the center point as is traditionally the case. Instead, there was a heavy emphasis on the experience of the brand itself. A majority of businesses in America to this day approach retail from a product view instead of a data view. However many of these stores (Germany included) to this day are still disconnected digitally (no wifi systems in place).

With 5G and AI we can **enable businesses to view their storefronts as a data engine**. Being a partner in enabling them to become truly digital within the confines of a brick and mortar location. 


## What it does
5G and AI can have a profound impact on SBA-designated Small Businesses. We stream video data from security and IoT devices. 

## How we built it
* React UI

## Challenges we ran into
* Pulling data from the actual vendor themselves (unless we partner), however, we can pull data from locations that do choose to install our app that can pull the data feed directly from the router itself, and encourage small businesses to adopt a 5G approach to security
* Streaming data on an open connection versus saving as chunks and blobs

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Machine Learning Model that can use video to detect 

## What we learned
* There is a challenge in 

## What's next for 
* Partner with a 5G security camera IoT provider
